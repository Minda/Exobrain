## Lentil Soup Ingredients

Here’s what you’ll need to make this soup:

- [**Lentils**](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-cook-lentils/), of course! The best types of lentils for this recipe are green lentils or French lentils, also known as Le Puy lentils. They hold their shape nicely in the soup, adding satisfying texture. Brown lentils are also a fine option. Red lentils are too mushy for this recipe. If you have them on hand, go check out my [red lentil soup](https://www.loveandlemons.com/red-lentil-soup/) instead!
- **Extra-virgin olive oil** – For richness.
- **Onion, garlic, carrot, and celery** – They create the soup’s aromatic base.
- **Fresh kale** – You’ll use the whole leaves, stems and all!
- **Fire-roasted diced tomatoes** – I love the smoky flavor that fire-roasted tomatoes add to this soup. In a pinch, regular diced tomatoes work here too!
- **Vegetable broth** – Make homemade [vegetable stock](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-make-vegetable-stock/), or use store-bought.
- **Fresh thyme** – For fresh, woodsy flavor. I like to bundle whole sprigs together with kitchen twine. Then, I add the bundle to the soup like a bay leaf, removing it before serving.
- **Cumin** – The secret ingredient! It adds savory, earthy depth.
- **White wine vinegar** – It gives the soup a tangy kick.
- **And salt and pepper** – To make all the flavors pop!

#### Recipe Variations

Don’t have these exact ingredients on hand? These swaps work nicely:

- Replace the kale with another leafy green like fresh spinach or [Swiss chard.](https://www.loveandlemons.com/swiss-chard/)
- Use 1 teaspoon dried thyme instead of the fresh sprigs.
- Replace the celery with 1 small fennel bulb, diced.
- No vinegar? Finish the soup with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice instead!

## How to Store Lentil Soup

**Store leftover soup** **in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.**Simply reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop.

I actually like this soup *better*leftover. The flavor only improves as it sits in the fridge!

#### Can you freeze lentil soup?

Yes, this vegan lentil soup is freezer-friendly! Allow it to cool to room temperature, and then seal it in airtight containers or jars, leaving an inch for the soup to expand at the top. Freeze for up to 3 months.
