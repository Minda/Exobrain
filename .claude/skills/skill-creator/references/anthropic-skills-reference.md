# Anthropic Skills to Consider When Creating a New Skill

**Source:** [https://github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

Before writing a new skill from scratch, check whether an existing skill in Anthropic’s repo already covers the need—or can be extended. Install via Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills`, then install `document-skills` or `example-skills`.

## When to Use This Reference

- **Creating a new skill** — Scan the categories below; if one matches your use case, read that skill’s SKILL.md in the repo first.
- **Extending document/file handling** — Prefer building on docx/pdf/pptx/xlsx if your task is creating or editing those formats.
- **MCP or tooling** — Check mcp-builder and web-artifacts-builder for patterns.
- **Design or comms** — Check brand-guidelines, frontend-design, internal-comms for structure and tone.

## Skills by Category

## Suggested workflow when creating a new skill

1. **Match to category** — Find the row above that best matches your goal (documents, MCP, design, comms, etc.).
2. **Open that skill in the repo** — e.g. `https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/<skill-name>`.
3. **Read its SKILL.md** — Note frontmatter, structure, and any scripts or references.
4. **Decide:** adopt/install that skill, fork and adapt it, or use it only as a pattern for your new skill.
5. **Use this skill-creator** — Follow the steps in SKILL.md (use case, components, init, write, package, iterate) so your skill fits this project’s structure and the Agent Skills spec.
