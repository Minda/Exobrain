# Saving ASCII Drawings

## Purpose
Preserve ASCII diagrams in a structured way that makes them discoverable and reusable across conversations.

## When to Use
- After creating any ASCII diagram worth preserving
- When a visual captures an important insight
- When user explicitly asks to save a diagram
- When the diagram might be referenced in future conversations

## How to Save

### 1. File Location
```
memories/drawings/[descriptive-name].md
```

### 2. File Structure Template
```markdown
# [Title of Diagram]

*Source: [Where this came from]*
*Created: [Date]*

## Visual Map/Diagram/Chart

```
[ASCII DIAGRAM HERE]
```

## Key Insights from the [Map/Diagram]

### [Section 1]
[What this part shows]

### [Section 2]
[What this part shows]

## Connection to My Work
[Why this matters to user's broader work]

*Note: [Any caveats or context needed]*
```

### 3. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names: `agi-ethics-discourse-map.md`
- Include what type: `map`, `flow`, `comparison`
- Keep it searchable and memorable

### 4. Essential Metadata
Always include:
- **Source** — What prompted this diagram (paper, conversation, insight)
- **Date** — When created
- **Purpose** — What it's meant to show
- **Connection** — How it relates to user's work

## Best Practices

### Make It Standalone
- Include enough context that the diagram makes sense months later
- Explain any abbreviations or special notation
- Note what simplifications were made

### Cross-Reference
- Link to related insights or memories if relevant
- Note if this updates or replaces an older diagram
- Mention if this is part of a series

### Version Control
- If updating an existing diagram, consider keeping the old version in a comment
- Note significant changes in the description

## Example Uses

### Conceptual Maps
- Academic paper structures
- Philosophical tensions
- System architectures
- Relationship dynamics

### Process Flows
- Workflow diagrams
- Decision trees
- Cognitive processes
- Information flows

### Comparisons
- Different approaches to problems
- Before/after states
- Competing theories
- Integration opportunities

## Integration with DigitalBrain

These drawings become part of your extended cognition:
- Quick visual references for complex ideas
- Anchors for remembering multi-faceted concepts
- Bridges between different domains of knowledge
- Carried-forward understanding made tangible

## Quick Checklist
- [ ] Created in `memories/drawings/`
- [ ] Has descriptive filename
- [ ] Includes source and date
- [ ] Has explanatory context
- [ ] Shows connection to broader work
- [ ] Is findable/searchable

*Remember: These drawings are cognitive tools. Save them when they capture something that text alone cannot convey efficiently.*
